                    As long as I could remember I always loved anything that had to do with creating something from scratch and imagination. 
                    Whether it was writing, drawing or painting I loved the feeling I got when a single line became a complex story, drawing or painting, it gave me a satisfaction that I couldn't get from anywhere else. 
                </p>
                <p class="p2">
                With tech I realised that it also gave me that exact feeling.
                The process of creating something beautiful out of a single idea or a line of code, the process of realising something from nothing was the exact thing that made me love art.
                 Which made web development, for me, a technological way of artistic expression. 
                 And this project is a testament to that.

                    When I'm not at home I'm either checking out museums, sightseeing in my city, cinema or eating out, but mostly if there is any cool events related to sketching and painting-- I'm there.
